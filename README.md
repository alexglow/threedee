CP1: When I worked in support at Sauce Labs, I would bribe the devs to help with questions by awarding them conceptual CoolPointz™. The CoolPointz™ saga quickly spirals into uncontrolled inflation and catastrophic collapse. But the legend lives on (because I bring it up at every possible opportunity). I went back for a LAN party and brought along some actual, physical CoolPointz™ to share. :)
